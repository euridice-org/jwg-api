# Introduction

This section provides background and context for understanding the EU Health Data API specification.

## Purpose and Scope

This Implementation Guide defines technical specifications for API-based access to European Electronic Health Record exchange Format (EEHRxF) data. See [Scope](scope.html) for details on what is and isn't covered by this specification.

## Regulatory Context

The specification addresses requirements from the European Health Data Space (EHDS) regulation. See [Regulatory Anchors](regulatoryAnchors.html) for details on how this IG relates to EHDS requirements and the work of the Xt-EHR Joint Action.

## Understanding the Technical Approach

The following pages provide conceptual background to help readers understand the technical choices made in this specification:

- **[FHIR Documents and Resources](fhir-documents-vs-resources.html)** - Explains the difference between document-based and resource-based exchange patterns and when to use each

- **[Relationship to XDS/XCA](xds-xca-bridge.html)** - Describes how this specification relates to existing XDS/XCA infrastructure and how IHE MHD serves as a bridge

- **[Member State Architectures](member-state-architectures.html)** - Shows how the specification accommodates different Member State architectural approaches (centralized, federated, hybrid)

## Next Steps

After understanding the background and context:
- Review the [Functional](functional.html) requirements to understand technical specifications
- Explore [Implementation](implementation.html) examples and use cases
- See [Actors and Transactions](actors.html) for the detailed actor model
