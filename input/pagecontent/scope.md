# Scope

This Implementation Guide defines technical specifications for API-based access to and exchange of European Electronic Health Record exchange Format (EEHRxF) data between systems.

## In Scope

This IG specifies:

- API definitions for accessing and exchanging EEHRxF data
- Actor definitions and transaction patterns using IHE and HL7 specifications
- Authorization and security requirements
- Patient identification mechanisms
- Document-based and resource-based exchange patterns

## Out of Scope

This IG does not specify:

- Logging Component requirements
- The EEHRxF content profiles themselves (these are defined in separate HL7 Europe IGs)
- National infrastructure APIs between healthcare providers
- Cross-border exchange protocols (governed by MyHealth@EU)

TODO: Expand with additional scope clarifications as needed.
