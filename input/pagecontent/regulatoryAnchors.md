# Patient Rights
TODO: Finish section. How rights are upheld depends on the context, and only some rights need interoperability specifications. Others are underspecified, like the patient right to insert information into their own EHR.

For example, the patient has an EHDS right to opt-out of primary use exchange. The patient enacts this opt out via the Health Data Access service patient portal, and this is stored in a member-state level registry. This registry is then checked by National infrastructure before releasing a patient's data cross-border. This consent check can be considered internal to national infrastructure.
