# Goals and Objectives

| Audience | What they get from this IG |
|----------|---------------|
| **EHR Systems** | Clear technical description of interoperability, clear path to EHDS compliance using globally recognized specs. Something a developer can read and implement. |
| **Member States** | Enables EHR Capability that fits their architecture (central/federated) and shows how this capability can support them in meeting their member-state obligations (patient access portal, provider access portal, field cross-border requests). Should feel like helping them meet their EHDS goals, not conflicting. |
| **Regulators** | Traceability to regulation text (D5.1), clear conformance path, testable (as much as possible supporting automated self-testing). |
